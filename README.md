- This is @TriEmbed the GitHub site for Triangle Embedded Interest Group
- We're an informal group of enthusiasts (beginners, students, professionals) sharing a common interest in embedded computing systems
- We meet every second Monday at 7pm on Jitsi (details on the email described here: https://triembed.org/email-list-info/ )
- We're currently focusing on a community project to create boards that combine versitile MPUs (currently ESP32 and ESP C3) with FPGAs such as the Dialog GreenPAK and Gowin parts. This first project, initiated in late 2021 resides in repos League, aardvark, the-ant, m80, firedeck and thetools.
